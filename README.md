## Introduction
---

> This is the first step towards building your first full web application: the AirBnB clone. This first step is very important because you will use what you build during this project with all other following projects: HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, front-end integration…
---

## Description
---

> I know you were waiting for it: it’s here!

The AirBnB clone project starts now until… the end of the first year. The goal of the project is to deploy on your server a simple copy of the AirBnB website.

You won’t implement all the features, only some of them to cover all fundamental concepts of the higher level programming track.

After 4 months, you will have a complete web application composed by:

 - A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like in a Shell (perfect for development and debugging)
 - A website (the front-end) that shows the final product to everybody: static and dynamic
 - A database or files that store data (data = objects)
 - An API that provides a communication interface between the front-end and your data (retrieve, create, delete, update them)

```
./console
```
